The school’s address is 765 Commonwealth Avenue, however the building itself is actually set back from Commonwealth Avenue behind other buildings. Our formation point for the race is behind Marsh Chapel on Bay State Road. The section of the road where the race begins is rarely used on the weekend and is not a public thruway. 
The race starts at 10:00am and runners head east on Bay State Road. The roadway between the formation point and Granby Street is rarely used on the weekend.  We utilize a BUPD and BPD police detail to limit traffic for the one-block area of Bay State Road between Granby Street and Silber Way, where very limited street traffic may occur.  The runners then turn left onto Silber Way (Sherborn St.) and over the footbridge crossing Storrow Drive onto the Esplanade. Runners continue in the same eastward direction on the Esplanade until they reach the first inlet of the Charles River Reservation. At this point the runners turn around and head back in the same direction from which they came, finishing the race at the School of Law.  Our race typically has around 250 participants.
