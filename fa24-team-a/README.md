# **BOSTON DISTRICT 7 INDICATORS: TEAM A**  

## **About the Project**  

Our project, in collaboration with Boston Councilor's Office, focuses on analyzing population and economic development data for District 7 in Boston. The primary aim is to identify trends and disparities, particularly among marginalized groups, and to assist in data-driven decision-making.  

### **Scope of the Analysis**  
Our analysis centers around two key areas:  
1. **Population Displacement:**  
   - Examining demographic trends, including race, ethnicity, age distribution, and education levels.  
   - Investigating patterns of displacement and population changes over the past 10 years.  

2. **Economic Development:**  
   - Analyzing metrics such as median household income, poverty analysis, the number of registered businesses, and job creation data for BIPOC workers.  
   - Identifying trends in business vibrancy, licensing, and workforce diversity within District 7.  

### **Methodology**  
- We utilized datasets from various public sources, covering a 10-year period to track changes in District 7 and compare them to citywide averages and, where applicable, other districts.  
- Data analysis was structured into two main areas of focus, with files and outputs categorized accordingly.  
- Following the analysis, we leveraged the finalized datasets to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau, providing clear and actionable visual insights.  

### **Final Deliverables**  
Our final deliverables include:  
- **Raw Datasets:** Unprocessed datasets used during the initial stages of analysis.  
- **Processed Datasets:** Cleaned and analyzed datasets, prepared for visualization and further exploration.
- **Python Notebook Files:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code and analysis workflows for both population displacement and economic development metrics. These files document the step-by-step approach used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A Tableau dashboard summarizing key findings, designed to facilitate quick and effective decision-making.  

These resources provide Councilor Anderson with a comprehensive understanding of District 7's demographic and economic landscape, highlighting areas of improvement and ongoing challenges.

## **Roadmap to the Repository**  

### **Repository Structure**  
The repository is organized to facilitate ease of navigation and access to resources:  

1. **`fa24-team-a` Folder**  
   This is the main project folder, containing all the work and analyses. Inside, you will find:  

   - **`Census Tracts`:**  
     - Contains geographic and demographic data at the census tract level, focusing on spatial patterns in population and economic metrics.
    
   - **`Dashboard-data`:**  
     - Includes the processed datasets used to create the Tableau dashboard.
     - Contains individual Tableau workbooks for the different metrics analyzed in the project.
    
   - **`Datasets`:**  
     - Raw datasets sourced from public repositories, used for the initial stages of analysis.

   - **`Population and Displacement`:**  
     - Includes files related to the analysis of population dynamics, displacement trends, and demographic changes over the past 10 years.  

   - **`Economic Development and Displacement`:**  
     - Contains analysis files and results focused on economic trends, including household income, business registrations, and job creation for BIPOC workers.

   - **`README.md`:**  
     - This file, providing an overview of the project and a guide to navigating the repository.  

### **Dashboard**  
The Tableau dashboard is a central deliverable of the project, offering a visual summary of key insights. It includes:  
- Trends in population demographics and displacement.  
- Economic indicators and business vibrancy in District 7.  
- Comparisons to Boston city averages, allowing for clear identification of disparities and progress.  

The dashboard is based on the processed datasets available in the repository and is designed to be intuitive and actionable.
