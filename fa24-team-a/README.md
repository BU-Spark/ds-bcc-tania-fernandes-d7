# BOSTON CITY COUNCILOR ANDERSON: DISTRICT 7 - TEAM A

## About the project

For our project with Councilor Anderson, we will be focusing on analyzing population and economic development data for District 7 in Boston. 

Our team will analyze various datasets, including population demographics such as race, ethnicity, age, and education levels, as well as economic indicators like household income, the number of registered businesses, and job data for BIPOC workers. We'll also be tracking these metrics over the past 10 years, looking at changes in the district compared to the Boston city average, and possibly other districts.

Our ultimate goal is to create a dashboard that visually presents these findings, helping Councilor Anderson identify areas where residents, particularly marginalized groups, are seeing improvements or facing ongoing challenges. We’ll iterate on the dashboard design with Councilor Anderson’s feedback to ensure it highlights the most critical insights.

All the relevant work and analysis is present in the `fa24-team-a` folder.
