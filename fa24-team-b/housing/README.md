# Project Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources, including data and Jupyter notebooks, used to address the specific questions posed by our client. The structure is organized into subfolders for easy navigation and efficient access to relevant materials.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: This folder contains all datasets utilized for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: This folder includes Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis process and results.

The **data/** folder contains sub-folders containing each of the separate datasets (census, household_pulse_surveys, income_restricted, property, rent_smart, along with a zip file for approved building permits). The sub-folders then contain multiple files that segregate the respective data into year-wise information.

The **notebooks/** folder contains our ipynb notebooks. Each notebook is titled with a name that corresponds to the dataset it contains analysis for. For example, d7-CensusData corresponds to the files in the data/census folder.

Each notebook contains preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and some insights for the corresponding datasets.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide insights and answers to the inquiries raised by our customer through thorough data analysis and visualization.
