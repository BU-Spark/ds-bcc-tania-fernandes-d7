It explores property trend, violation statistics, income-restricted housing needs, and other housing-related questions in District 7. At the end, we will perform comparative analysis between District 7 and Boston. If time permits, we will also compare District 7 to Massachusetts."

We also addressed questions about Section 8 vouchers, a form of government assistance that helps low-income families, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities afford housing in the private market. Our analysis sought to determine how many units accept these vouchers, offering insight into the availability of subsidized housing."
