For our project with Councilor Anderson, we will be focusing on analyzing population and economic development data for District 7 in Boston. 

Our team will analyze various datasets, including population demographics such as race, ethnicity, age, and education levels, as well as economic indicators like household income, the number of registered businesses, and job data for BIPOC workers. We'll also be tracking these metrics over the past 10 years, looking at changes in the district compared to the Boston city average, and possibly other districts.

Our ultimate goal is to create a dashboard that visually presents these findings, helping Councilor Anderson identify areas where residents, particularly marginalized groups, are seeing improvements or facing ongoing challenges. We’ll iterate on the dashboard design with Councilor Anderson’s feedback to ensure it highlights the most critical insights.

In our early insights we analyzed Boston 311 service request data to understand the distribution of opened and closed cases across the city. We cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant or missing information and focused on filtering cases by their status—opened or closed. 
This allowed us to assess the city's responsiveness to non-emergency issues like potholes, streetlights, and waste management.
It is under the name 311_exploration.ipynb file name in the f24-team-a folder.

Using GeoPandas and a Boston Shapefile, we created heatmaps to visualize the geographical distribution of these cases. 
Those are under the names:  Boston_case_heatmap.html and a Boston_case_map.html

Opened cases represent unresolved issues, while closed cases indicate resolved ones. The heatmaps highlighted areas with high concentrations of service requests, providing insight into neighborhoods needing more attention and the overall effectiveness of the 311 system.
